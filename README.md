Tidy is designed specifically for tree layout. Graph and DAG data are not supported.

The layout algorithm is based on paper _"Drawing non-layered tidy trees in linear time"_.

## A note on the package's ownership

In this branch, we (Hackworth Ltd) have changed the name of the package (and other package metadata) to point to our fork, so that we can publish the package using GitHub Packages and more easily use it in our own applications, as the upstream author has not yet published this package to a public `npm` registry. We want to make clear that we are *not* claiming ownership on this package: the source code, copyright, and license all belong to the upstream author.
